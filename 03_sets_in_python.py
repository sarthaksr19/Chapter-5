# set does not support repeatitive item

a = {1,2,3,4,5,1,1}
print(a)  #1 is repeatitive so it doesn't print in set
# print(type(a))

# Important: this syntax will create an empty dictionary not an empty set

a ={} 
print(type(a))

# an empty set can be created by below syntax
b = set()
print(type(b))
